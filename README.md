Ingress Farm Route
==================

Route planner for hacking Ingress portals.


Usage
-------------------
- Download getElements JSON data from ingress.com/intel
- Get OpenStreetMap key.
- Look at Example Mapping.ipynb in IPython Notebook for now.
- Okay, this doesn't actually work. Can't use what isn't written yet.

TODO:
-------------------
- Get route nodes into graph form
- Use NetworkX to do path minimization stuff (I think, this is out of my league and will be stolen from the internet)
- Automate grabbing of portal data. Perhaps using selenium webdriver. 
- Plot stuff not in notebooks. (Flask or Django I'd presume)
